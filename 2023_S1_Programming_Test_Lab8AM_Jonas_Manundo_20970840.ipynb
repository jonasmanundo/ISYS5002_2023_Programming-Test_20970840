        "BeeGeez Retail is a store that sells various types of electronic gadgets. The store manager wants to analyse the weekly sales revenue generated by a particular product to make informed decisions regarding pricing and marketing strategies. The product is a new smartphone model that the store recently started selling.\n",
        "\n",
        "To accomplish this task, the store manager has asked you to develop a Python program that can calculate and visualise the weekly sales revenue for the product. The program should prompt the user to enter the name of the product and the sales data for each week, including the price and quantity sold.\n",
        "\n",
        "The program should be able to handle any number of weeks entered by the user and generate the weekly revenue data for each week. The program should also write the weekly revenue data to a CSV file and generate a graph to visually represent the sales revenue.\n",

        "Based on the sales data analysis, the store manager will be able to make informed decisions regarding pricing and marketing strategies to maximise the revenue generated by the product.\n",
